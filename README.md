# Dino-Rhythm-Game
The Dino Rhythm Game is the first videogame project that is being fully developed on my own. I am completing this project as part of an assignment in my 3D Game Development class as well as a submission for the [Game Development Month Game Jam](http://gamedevelopmonth.com/) Once it is completed and released it will be found on [My Itch.io Page](https://juniperistic.itch.io/).
If you are curious about the various prefabs & assets that I have used in my project be sure to check out the [License.txt](https://github.com/Juniperistic/Dino-Rhythm-Game/blob/15d2ac4b865f05b0164e028b22be9f2e65eadd08/__Scripts/License.txt) for all of that information. Unfortunately due to copyright & things of that nature I am unsure if I am able to upload the prefabs that I have created directly onto this repo.
