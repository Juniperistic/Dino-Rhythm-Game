# Dino-Rhythm-Game
The Dino Rhythm Game is the first videogame project that is being fully developed on my own. I am completing this project as part of an assignment in my 3D Game Development class as well as a submission for the Game Develop Month Gamejam. More info for this game jam can be found at: http://gamedevelopmonth.com/ Once it is completed and released it will be found on my itch.io page at: https://juniperistic.itch.io/
